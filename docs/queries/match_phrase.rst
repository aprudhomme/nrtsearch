Match Phrase Query
==========================

A query that analyzes the text before finding matching documents. The tokens resulting from the analysis are combined into a Lucene PhraseQuery.

Proto definition:

.. code-block::

   message MatchPhraseQuery {
       string field = 1; // Field in the document to query.
       string query = 2; // The text to query with.
       int32 slop = 3; // Edit distance between respective positions of tokens generated by analyzing this query and the positions of terms in a document.
       Analyzer analyzer = 4; // Analyzer used to analyze the query. If not provided, the default search analyzer for the field would be used instead.
       ZeroTerms zeroTermsQuery = 5; // Indicates whether none or all documents are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens. Valid values are NONE_ZERO_TERMS and ALL_ZERO_TERMS.

       // Zero Terms options when analyzer removes all tokens.
       enum ZeroTerms {
           // No documents are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens.
           NONE_ZERO_TERMS = 0;
           // All documents are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens.
           ALL_ZERO_TERMS = 1;
       }
   }
